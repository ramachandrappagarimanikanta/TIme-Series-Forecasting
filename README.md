# TIme-Series-Forecasting
This project implements a Time Series Forecasting model using LSTM networks to predict future values based on historical data. The model captures long-term dependencies in sequential data, making it effective for forecasting trends and patterns. Results are evaluated using error metrics and visualized to compare actual versus predicted values.
